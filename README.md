# Check how users on twitter think about a specific twitter account

This program provides a simple GUI that lets the user insert a Twitter account name and a number of recent tweets. At this moment, the number of tweets will be extracted starting from now and going back in time, until the number of tweets extracted equals the provided number by the user.
Also, at this moment, the tweets are filtered on the English Language, and the extracted & filtered & analyzed tweets are exported to a CSV file. This functinoality will be changed in the future, where the analysis will be presented in the GUI.
